# CreateClassificationRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**model** | **String** | ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models/overview) for descriptions of them. | 
**query** | **String** | Query to be classified. | 
**examples** | Option<[**Vec<Vec<String>>**](array.md)> | A list of examples with labels, in the following format:  `[[\"The movie is so interesting.\", \"Positive\"], [\"It is quite boring.\", \"Negative\"], ...]`  All the label strings will be normalized to be capitalized.  You should specify either `examples` or `file`, but not both.  | [optional]
**file** | Option<**String**> | The ID of the uploaded file that contains training examples. See [upload file](/docs/api-reference/files/upload) for how to upload a file of the desired format and purpose.  You should specify either `examples` or `file`, but not both.  | [optional]
**labels** | Option<**Vec<String>**> | The set of categories being classified. If not specified, candidate labels will be automatically collected from the examples you provide. All the label strings will be normalized to be capitalized. | [optional]
**search_model** | Option<**String**> | ID of the model to use for [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create). You can select one of `ada`, `babbage`, `curie`, or `davinci`. | [optional][default to ada]
**temperature** | Option<**f32**> | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. | [optional][default to 0]
**logprobs** | Option<**i32**> | Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.  The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5. If you need more than this, please contact us through our [Help center](https://help.openai.com) and describe your use case.  When `logprobs` is set, `completion` will be automatically added into `expand` to get the logprobs.  | [optional]
**max_examples** | Option<**i32**> | The maximum number of examples to be ranked by [Search](/docs/api-reference/searches/create) when using `file`. Setting it to a higher value leads to improved accuracy but with increased latency and cost. | [optional][default to 200]
**logit_bias** | Option<[**serde_json::Value**](.md)> | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.  Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.  As an example, you can pass `{\"50256\": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.  | [optional]
**return_prompt** | Option<**bool**> | If set to `true`, the returned JSON will include a \"prompt\" field containing the final prompt that was used to request a completion. This is mainly useful for debugging purposes. | [optional][default to false]
**return_metadata** | Option<**bool**> | A special boolean flag for showing metadata. If set to `true`, each document entry in the returned JSON will contain a \"metadata\" field.  This flag only takes effect when `file` is set.  | [optional][default to false]
**expand** | Option<[**Vec<serde_json::Value>**](serde_json::Value.md)> | If an object name is in the list, we provide the full information of the object; otherwise, we only provide the object ID. Currently we support `completion` and `file` objects for expansion. | [optional][default to []]
**user** | Option<**String**> | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).  | [optional]
